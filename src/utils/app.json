      "description": "I am a firm believer that we cannot control our thoughts and they're like the flow of a river, sometimes cool and calm, sometimes rippling. Once we tend to start accepting, acknowledging them as the way they're and reflecting on them, the beauty in them is felt and they become the best to lose in them. Words can be another best of our friends to add beauty to those thoughts and feelings generated by them. This book is a collection of many such unspoken thoughts passing through the layers of my mind, coated with the words and then stuck on to the paper to freeze them"
